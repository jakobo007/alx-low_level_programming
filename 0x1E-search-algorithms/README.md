Search algorithms are algorithms designed to retrieve information from a set of data or data structure. 

Linear search -> This algorithms sequencially checks all the elements of a data structure until it finds the target or checks the entire database/list/data structure

-> Has a linear time complexity of 0(n) in the worst case
    -> Best case 0(1)
